# WDI Seattle Install Fest

For the first portion of the class, we'll be working exclusively inside of the browser and Node. We'll be installing the following tools.

* Slack
* Homebrew
* Git
* Node
* Oh my ZSH
* iTerm
* Postgres.app
* Ruby
* Rails

## Slack

We will be using slack to communicate throughout the course. You should've received an invite to our channels via e-mail. You can login via the web browser, but downloading / installing the app is highly recommended.

[Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads)

## GArnet

~~We will be using GArnet to manage the course. You'll be able to see a list of assigned deliverables, submissions, evaluations, and your attendance record. Your managers will give you an invite link.~~

GA Seattle isn't currently using this system - your homework progress and attendance will be reported to you regularly by your instructor and is also available on request.

## Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager that we will use to install various command line tools in our class.

Open up terminal, and paste the following command to install Homebrew. You might be prompted to install XCode Command Line Tools during the install process.

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

You may be prompted to installed XCode command line tools. When prompted, click and install through that, and you're homebrew installation will continue.

After the installation process, run the command `brew doctor`. If any warnings or errors are displayed, we will need to resolve them before proceeding with the rest of the install fest.

## Xcode

Speaking of Xcode, install Xcode through the App Store. [Link here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

## GIT
Before we do this process, please make sure you have signed up for an account on [Github](http://www.github.com). We will be installing a version of GIT from home brew and also configuring it.

To install GIT
```
brew install git
```

#### Configuring GIT

Using your email credentials for GIT, run these commands with your user and email configured.

```
git config --global user.name "YOUR-USERNAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS"
git config --global push.default simple
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

#### Setting up SSH Key

You might find your self having to re-authenticate GIT every time you work on your command line. Setup SSH Keys to let Github remember your machine in the future.

* [Github Generating SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)

## Node

To install Node
```
brew install node
```

Verify the installation afterwards by running

```
node -v
npm -v
```

The above should display without any errors.

To finish up your installation, run this command to allow for global installations of npm tools.

```
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib
```


# Sublime Text 3 and/or Atom
We'll be running Atom and Sublime Text 3 as our text editors of choice. You can use either or both of these.

### Sublime Text 3

Download and install version 3 from [http://www.sublimetext.com/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)

It is a pretty typical installation for an app, but we need to add a shortcut so we can load sublime from the Terminal.

```
ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl
```

Restart terminal, and you should be able to open a folder to edit by typing `subl .`

### Atom

Download and install Atom from [here](https://atom.io/)

For a command line shortcut, run this:

```
ln -s /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh /usr/local/bin/atom
```

Now you can open a folder from your terminal by typing: `atom .`

## Install Oh My ZSH

Oh my ZSH?!!! We will be tricking out commandline with another shell. A shell is an interface into our computer, and we will be using a lot to run commands.

We'll be using a shell and configuration package called [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

To install, we will run

```
curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh
```

Restart Terminal, and you should see a brand new and colorful command prompt.

## Postgres

### Postgres.app
We will be using a relational database called Postgres for Node and Rails portion our class.

Download and install from [http://postgresapp.com/](http://postgresapp.com/)

If you have successfully configured zsh and sublime or atom, the following command should work.

```
subl ~/.zshrc
```

-OR-

```
atom ~/.zshrc
```

Your sublime (or Atom) editor will popup with configuration settings, at the bottom of the file append

```
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.6/bin
```

While we're here, add these two functions and environment variables to make it easier to access, change and refresh our ZSH configuration file in the future. Copy and paste these to the end of the file.

If you plan on using Sublime Text copy this:

```
export VISUAL=subl
export EDITOR="$VISUAL"

function zedit() {
  subl ~/.zshrc
}

function zrefresh() {
  echo "Refreshing your ZSH configuration."
  source ~/.zshrc
}
```

Otherwise, if you plan on using Atom, copy this instead:

```
export VISUAL=atom
export EDITOR="$VISUAL"

function zedit() {
  atom ~/.zshrc
}

function zrefresh() {
  echo "Refreshing your ZSH configuration."
  source ~/.zshrc
}
```

Save the file, close Sublime (or Atom), and restart your terminal.

Type `which psql` at which point should display

```
/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.5/bin/psql
```

### Install Postgres GUI

We'll be using **Postico**. Install here:

https://eggerapps.at/postico/

## Installing MongoDB

```
#Install MongoDB
brew install mongodb

#make data directory
sudo mkdir -p /data/db

#get your user name
whoami

#set data directory permissions (replacing USERNAME with the result from whoami above)
sudo chown -R USERNAME:wheel /data
```

### Testing the MongoDB server

```
#Start the MongoDB server
mongod
```

Press `control-c` to stop the server.

### Install MongoDB GUI

We'll be using **RoboMongo**. Install here:

https://robomongo.org/


## Installing Ruby on Rails

### Install rbenv
rbenv lets us change ruby verions on the fly, useful for working with diffrent versions.

```
brew update
brew install rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

sudo chown -R $USER ~/.rbenv
```

### Configuring rbenv
__Note: new versions of Ruby and Rails are released regularly. Check with your instructor whether the versions listed below is appropriate__

```
brew update

brew install ruby-build

rbenv install 2.4.1
rbenv global 2.4.1
```

### Install Rails

```
echo "gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc" > ~/.gemrc
```

Restart your terminal. The command above will install gems without documentation (which can take up time when installing Rails)

```
sudo gem update
sudo gem install rails
```
You may need to press "yes" for various entries

## Verify your installation

Make sure to restart your terminal and then run each of these commands. Finally call someone over to validate your installation is correct.

```
rails -v
ruby -v

which ruby
which rails
which bundle
which gem

node -v
npm -v

git --version
psql --version
subl -v (or atom -v)

```

### Overwriting an existing Ruby installation

You may already have an old version of Ruby installed. In this case, it may be easiest to update your Ruby version with [RVM - Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/rvm/install#basic-install). The stable option will install RVM with the latest stable (tested and approved) version of Ruby.

```
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

### RVM Cheat Sheet
Now that you have RVM, some useful commands it can perform:

```
rvm list known
```

This lists all known versions of Ruby 

```
rvm install X.X
```

Install version X.X of Ruby (where you replace the X's with the appropriate version number you would like to install).

```
rvm use X.X
```

If you have multiple versions of Ruby, you must tell your computer which one to use as the primary or default version.

```
rvm use X.X --default
```

This does the same as the above command, but additionally sets this version of Ruby as the default for any new shells you might use.

Refer to [RVM documentation](https://rvm.io/) for any further RVM questions.
