## Order of SQL Clauses

![SQL Clauses](SQLClauses.png)

## Selecting specific data

Not equal - `<>`

```
- LIKE - SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE '%';
- DISTINCT - SELECT DISTINCT name FROM students;
- ORDER BY - SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY name DESC;
- COUNT - SELECT count(*) FROM students;
- MAX - SELECT max(age) FROM students;
- MIN - SELECT min(age) FROM students;
- AND - SELECT * from students WHERE name = 'Elie' AND age = 26;
- OR - SELECT * from students WHERE name = 'Elie' OR name ='Mary';
- IN - SELECT * FROM students WHERE name IN ('Bob', 'Tom');
- NOT IN - SELECT * FROM students WHERE name NOT IN ('Bob', 'Tom');
- LIMIT - SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 2;
- OFFSET - SELECT * FROM students OFFSET 1;
- LIMIT + OFFSET - SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1;
- % - SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE '%b';
```

## GROUP BY

We use an aggregate function to get the total count of movies in a table.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies;
```

What about getting the count of something more specific in movies, such as the count of each rating?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(rating) FROM movies;
```

We get the same result. GROUP BY allows you to 'group' the table by a specific attribute, which is then provided to the aggregate function.
```sql
SELECT rating, COUNT(rating) FROM movies
GROUP BY rating;
```

## Alter Table Command

```sql
ALTER TABLE books ADD CONSTRAINT author_id
FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors (author_id)
ON DELETE NO ACTION;

ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN year_released INTEGER;

ALTER TABLE books ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL;
```

### Easier to add Constraints when creating a table
```sql
DROP TABLE books;
CREATE TABLE books (
	book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	author_id INTEGER REFERENCES authors(author_id)
);
```

## Nested queries

What if I want to do something very specific, but I need to get groups of results? For example:

1. Get titles of movies with the highest ratings.
2. Get titles of movies with the lowest ratings.

Let's try it using WHERE

```sql
SELECT title FROM movies
WHERE rating = MAX(rating);
```

That will give us an error, because MAX is an aggregate function and can't be used in WHERE.

Solution: Nested queries.

```sql
SELECT MAX(rating) FROM movies;
```

This will return the maximum rating, which we need to feed into WHERE.

```sql
SELECT title FROM movies
WHERE rating = (
	SELECT MAX(rating) FROM movies
);
```

### Aliases

Aliases are a piece of a SQL query that allows you to temporarily rename a table or column for the current query. This is useful for creating shorthand names for tables when using table prefixes, renaming columns, or differentiating tables when you join the same table more than once in a query (eliminating ambiguity).

####
```sql
SELECT
    users.userID AS 'id',
    users.username AS 'name'
FROM users;
```

--

```sql
SELECT * FROM authors a
    INNER JOIN books b
        ON a.author_id = b.author_id
ORDER BY a.author_id ASC;
```

--

```sql
SELECT * FROM crew
    LEFT JOIN users photographer
        ON crew.fk_photographer = photographer.userID
    LEFT JOIN users director
        ON crew.fk_director = director.userID
    LEFT JOIN users model
        ON crew.fk_model = model.userID
ORDER BY crew.crewID ASC;
```

### Conditionals

#### CASE Statement
The CASE statement is used when you want to display different things depending on the data that you've queried from the database. There's two different ways to structure a CASE statement shown below. Note that in the first example you can only compare against single values while in the second example you can use actual expressions for evaluation. Also note that CASE statements require an ELSE statement.

```sql
SELECT
    CASE users.age
        WHEN 0 THEN 'baby'
        WHEN 15 THEN 'teen'
        ELSE 'adult'
    END AS 'age'
FROM users;
```

--

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN users.age < 13 THEN 'preteen'
        WHEN users.age < 20 THEN 'teen'
        ELSE 'adult'
    END AS 'UserAge'
FROM users;
```

### Unions

Unions are the compilation of one or more disparate SQL queries that have the same columns. These are helpful when doing data aggregation that requires multiple SQL statements with different sets of joins and where clauses, but that return the same type of data.

Note: Unioned SQL statements MUST have the exact same columns (matching names) in the exact same order.

In the example below, I want all users and the number of photographs taken that they have "been a part of". In my first query I'm selecting photographers. In my second I'm selecting directors. In my third I'm selecting editors. But I want everything to display as just individual users with a 'role' column that I've manually set.

```sql
SELECT
	users.id,
	users.name,
    'Photographer' AS 'role',
	COUNT(photos.id) AS 'photoCount'
FROM photoShoots
	INNER JOIN users
		ON photoShoots.fk_photographerUserId = users.id
	INNER JOIN photos
		ON photoShoots.id = photos.fk_photoShootsId
GROUP BY users.id, users.name

UNION

SELECT
	users.id,
	users.name,
    'Director' AS 'role',
	COUNT(photos.id) AS 'photoCount'
FROM photoShoots
	INNER JOIN users
		ON photoShoots.fk_directorUserId = users.id
	INNER JOIN photos
		ON photoShoots.id = photos.fk_photoShootsId
GROUP BY users.id, users.name

UNION

SELECT
	users.id,
	users.name,
	'Editor' AS 'role',
	COUNT(photos.id) AS 'photoCount'
FROM photoShoots
	INNER JOIN users
		ON photoShoots.fk_editorUserId = users.id
	INNER JOIN photos
		ON photoShoots.id = photos.fk_photoShootsId
GROUP BY users.id, users.name;
    
```
