#Flexbox

Another method for creating responsive, aligned content is by using a new layout method called **Flexbox**. Flexbox allows items in a container to be laid out efficiently, even when the size of the container and/or items is unknown (thus the prefix *flex*)

Flexbox has [good support on modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox), with the exception of bugs on Internet Explorer. That said, it's safe to say that we can use Flexbox in circumstances where we either have a fallback for IE users. 

Instead of going through Flexbox notes, play the following game called Flexbox Froggy. It'll teach you everything you need to know about Flexbox.
