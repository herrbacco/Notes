#JavaScript Conditionals and Loops

##Objectives

* Describe the benefits of altering control flow in JavaScript
* Use boolean statements to return true and false values
* Utilize if/else statements in order to skip blocks of code
* Utilize for, for...in, and while loops to loop through data structures and repeat code
* Identify truthy and falsey values

##Control Flow

A program can be read from top to bottom, but eventually we'll need ways to **skip** over code or **repeat** code. In other words, we need to alter the control flow of the program. Here are some of the statements we'll be using.

2. [switch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)
3. [while](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)
4. [for](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)
5. [for...in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)

But before that, let's create the expressions needed for these statements.
