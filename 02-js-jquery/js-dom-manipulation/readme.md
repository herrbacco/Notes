# DOM Manipulation
So far we've only seen examples of how to change properties of the DOM
and do things like:

- change the `textContent` of an element
- swap an existing image tag with another
- attach click listeners
- add/remove CSS classes
- modify CSS

We haven't seen the true power of DOM manipulation. The power to create and
destroy DOM elements!!

After this lesson, complete this lab: <https://github.com/ga-students/dom-times-table>

## Creating DOM Elements
The DOM allows us to create elements (make and add new HTML elements to our page).
We can create any HTML tag we want. We can make `<a>` tags, `<p>` tags, `<div>`'s.
Really anything.

To create any new element we follow three basic steps:

1. **create** a new element and save it to a variable
2. **modify** any properties of the element
3. **attach** the element to an existing element on the page

Let's look at an example of how to create a new element in JavaScript and add it
to a page.

### Adding A New Link to the Bottom of a Page

```js
var a = document.createElement("a");
a.href = "http://thefair.com/";
a.textContent = "thefair.com";

document.body.appendChild(a);
```

First, we use `document.createElement` and pass a string representing the tag we
want to create. In this case we pass `"a"` to say we want to make a new link anchor
tag. Save the result of the function into a variable.

`document.createElement` returns a new anchor tag. The element saved in our var
has properties like any other anchor tag on the page, except they're all empty
because it was just created. We must manually add `href` and `textContent` to
set the link and display text.

Finally, we add the new anchor tag to the `<body>` with `document.body.appendChild`.
This adds the anchor to the bottom of the page.

#### .appendChild()
The `appendChild()` function exists for all HTML elements. It's easy to show how to
add things to the end of the body of the page because body is a property on the
global document variable.

In order to append a new element to any other element, simply obtain a reference
to it first. Here's an example showing how to add a new list item to an unordered
list of my favorite movies.

```html
<ul id="my-favorite-movies">
  <li>Rushmore</li>
  <li>Star Trek VI: Undiscovered Country</li>
  <li>Anchorman</li>
</ul>
```

```js
// obtain a reference to where we'll add it
var list = document.getElementById("my-favorite-movies");

// CREATE
var newMovie = document.createElement("li");

// MODIFY
newMovie.textContent = "Pirates of Silicon Valley";

// ATTACH
list.appendChild(newMovie);
```

And there you have it!

#### .insertBefore()

It's easy to add things to the end of the body, at the bottom of a div, or at the
end of a list. We have to do slightly more work if we want to add a new element
at the beginning or in the middle of an existing element.

Use the following syntax:

```js
var insertedNode = parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode);
```

* `parentNode` refers to the container (like body, or a div, or a list)
* `newNode` refers to the element we're adding
* `referenceNode` referes to an element that already exists in the `parentNode`

We can obtain a reference to all of the elements attached to a `parentNode`
by accessing the `children` property.

Here's what it looks like all together:

```js
var list = document.getElementById("my-favorite-movies");

var newMovie = document.createElement("li");
newMovie = "Dr. Strangelove";

// get a reference to the first element inside the list
var first = list.children[0];

// use insertBefore to add newMovie just before the first element.
list.insertBefore(newMovie, first);
```

Of course, you can choose any of the children of an element as a `referenceNode`
for `insertBefore`. The new element will simply be added in the spot just before
whatever you choose.

## Creating Complex DOM Elements
It's possible to build up complex arrangements of HTML elements in JavaScript
and add them to the page.

```html
<div class="chat-message">
  <div class="info">
    <img class="profile-pic" src="netizen42.png" />
    <div class="username">netizen42</div>
    <div class="timestamp">10:34 PM</div>
  </div>
  <div class="message">I'm hacking into the mainframe now. You better be ready.</div>
</div>
```

```js
// create a new div for each container div
var chat = document.createElement("div");
var info = document.createElement("div");

// create elements inside the info container
var img = document.createElement("img");
var user = document.createElement("div");
var time = document.createElement("div");

// create the div for the simple chat message
var msg = document.createElement("div");

img.classList.add("profile-pic");
img.src = "netizen42.png";

user.classList.add("username");
user.textContent = "netizen42";

time.classList.add("timestamp");
time.textContent = "10:34 PM";


msg.classList.add("message");
msg.textContent = "I'm hacking into the mainframe now. You better be ready.";

// add the image, the user and the timestamp to the info container
info.appendChild(img);
info.appendChild(user);
info.appendChild(time);

// add the info container and the message to the total chat container
chat.appendChild(info);
chat.appendChild(msg);

// finally, attach the entire new structure to some container on the page.
var parent = document.getElementById("some-container");
parent.appendChild(chat);
```

And there you go! It requires lots of writing, but the ability to create truly
new and complex DOM elements on-the-fly within JavaScript is awesome!

## The Case Against `.innerHTML`
It's true that instead of doing any of those fancy DOM manipulation we could
just use set `.innerHTML` equal to strings.

- Using `innerHTML` may be a security concern. Someone can sneak malicious
  content on your page. Using `.textContent` guarantees strings will only
  appear as text.

  Imagine if someone posted this as their status on Facebook and Facebook
  rendered it with `.innerHTML`. If status appeared in your page you
  would be redirected to an evil website!

  ```html
  <script>
  window.location = "http://evil.com";
  </script>
  ```
- Using `innerHTML` requires of string manipulation when it's mixed with
  functions and parameters. These lines get long, and it's easy to confuse
  when to use necessary single-quotes or double-quotes to make attributes
  in HTML tags render correctly.

  As elements become more complex innerHTML becomes hairier to use and you'll
  find that creating elements as described here offers more modularity and
  fine-grain control over how things are added to the page.

  It totally works, but I'm telling you, I promise, it gets nasty!

  ```js
  var username = "netizen42";
  var now = new Date();
  var timestamp = now.getHour() + ":" + now.getMinutes();

  var message = "I'm hacking into the mainframe now. You better be ready."

  var container = document.getElementById("some-container");
  container.innerHTML = "<div class='chat-message'>" +
      "<div class='info'>" +
        "<img class='profile-pic' src='" + username + ".png' />" +
        "<div class='username'>" + username + "</div>" +
        "<div class='timestamp'>" + timestamp + " </div>" +
      "</div>" +
      "<div class='message'>" + message + "</div>" +
    "</div>";
  ```

- A final reason to prefer manual DOM manipulation over `.innerHTML` is
  that it's much faster. The browser is optimized to make changes to
  the DOM via the `.appendChild`, `insertBefore` methods described here.

  The browser spends more time manually computing how to interpret string
  content added via `.innerHTML`.

## Destroying DOM Elements

It's way easier to remove elements than it is to add them. Use this syntax:

```
// straight up remove an element without remorse.
parent.removeChild(child);

// you may optional save a reference to the element that was removed.
var oldChild = parent.removeChild(child);
```

`.removeChild()` allows you to remove any element you have reference
to. Notice that it returns a reference to the node you removed. You
may choose to save this to a variable or not. If you save a removed
element to a variable then you have access to it and can add it to
somewhere else on the page.

## Moving Elements

Practice saving the return value of `.removeChild()` and passing it to
`.appendChild()` to move elements from one list to another.

Hook the functionality up to a button so you move one brunch item to the
lunch list every time it is clicked. Prevent any errors from occuring
if there's nothing left in the breakfast list.

```
<button id="brunch">move to brunch</button>

<h1>Breakfast</h1>
<ul id="breakfast-foods">
  <li>Pancakes</li>
  <li>Waffles</li>
  <li>French Toast</li>
</ul>

<h1>Lunch</h1>
<ul id="lunch-foods">
  <li>Hamburger</li>
  <li>Sandwich</li>
</ul>
```
