# Organization and APIs with Express

##Objectives

* Name the components of an Express application
* Utilize layouts and controllers in an Express app
* Describe the purpose of using an API on the backend.
* Create an application that uses an API and the `request` module.

## Review

Express gives us a lot of flexibility out of the box (configuration over convention). While this is a good thing, it can become a problem when we don't take the time to organize our project.
